title: "Create your first flow"
---

To create a flow, you will need to have a good description and name, so the LLM model (planning engine) can understand what you want to achieve, with many customers we were able to achieve +98% accuracy with better descriptions and names.


## Create a flow

- Open your OpenCopilot dashboard navigate to the flows section and click on the `+` button to create a new flow.
- Give your flow a name and description.
- Click on the `Create` button to create your flow.
- Now you can add steps to your flow either .

    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    playsinline
    className="w-full aspect-video"
    src="images/flow-creation.mp4"
></video>


Notice how we did not define any loops or conditions, OpenCopilot will automatically detect them for you based on the user context/message and the flow definition.
